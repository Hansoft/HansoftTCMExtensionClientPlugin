HansoftSAFeExtensionClientPlugin
================================

About this program
------------------
This program is a Hansoft SDK client plugin that adds functionality to the Hansoft client. Note that to use this
program you need to have the SDK option enabled on your Hansoft Server.

This plugin is part of the Hansoft Scaled Agile Support kit [1] and adds a menu item to the right-click menu in Hansoft called "SAFe",
with a sub-menu item "Add feature...". Applying the "Add feature..." menu action to an epic in the SAFe portfolio backlog will prompt
you to create a feature item to a program backlog in a separate Hansoft project. A Hansoft link will be added between the epic
and the created feature.
